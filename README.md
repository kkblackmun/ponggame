# Impossible Pong Game
## First attempt at a game using Python!

I wanted to make something a little different than the typical Pong game.

I changed the restrictions to randomly generate a location for the ping pong ball if it happens to hit the sidelines of the screen. This change causes it to be spontaneous and given the restrictions of the paddles, you sometimes cannot save the ball.

Despite its restrictions, it is a more fun game because it isn't as easy to win. And randomness and unfair advantages are sometimes amusing.

I also added Prompt screens to allow for you and your opponent to customize your names. I am considering also allowing a feature where people can select the color schemes so they have something more appealing to work with.

Implemented using the Turtle and Random Libraries 

Hope this is fun for some of you guys!
